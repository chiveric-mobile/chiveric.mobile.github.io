<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may collect information from you through automatic tracking systems (such as information about your browsing preferences) as well as through information that you volunteer to us (such as information that you provide during a registration process or at other times while using the <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>, as described above).</p>
<p>For example, we use cookies to make your browsing experience easier and more intuitive: cookies are small strings of text used to store some information that may concern the user, his or her preferences or the device they are using to access the Internet (such as a computer, tablet, or mobile phone). Cookies are mainly used to adapt the operation of the site to your expectations, offering a more personalized browsing experience and memorizing the choices you made previously.</p>
<p>A cookie consists of a reduced set of data transferred to your browser from a web server and it can only be read by the server that made the transfer. This is not executable code and does not transmit viruses.</p>
<p>Cookies do not record or store any Personal Data. If you want, you can prevent the use of cookies, but then you may not be able to use our <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span> as we intend. To proceed without changing the options related to cookies, simply continue to use our <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Technical cookies: </strong>Technical cookies, which can also sometimes be called HTML cookies, are used for navigation and to facilitate your access to and use of the site. They are necessary for the transmission of communications on the network or to supply services requested by you. The use of technical cookies allows the safe and efficient use of the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can manage or request the general deactivation or cancelation of cookies through your browser. If you do this though, please be advised this action might slow down or prevent access to some parts of the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cookies may also be retransmitted by an analytics or statistics provider to collect aggregated information on the number of users and how they visit the <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>. These are also considered technical cookies when they operate as described.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Temporary session cookies are deleted automatically at the end of the browsing session - these are mostly used to identify you and ensure that you don't have to log in each time - whereas permanent cookies remain active longer than just one particular session.</p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Support in configuring your browser: </strong>You can manage cookie through the settings of your browser on your device. However, deleting cookies from your browser may remove the preferences you have set for this <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>.</p>
